# TIC-TAC-TOE

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Play and compete against a friend. This project is designed for learning fundamental programming concepts, game logic.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Easy to understand interface
- Clear win, lose, and draw detection
- Simple codebase suitable for beginners



## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players alternate turns, entering their move by specifying the grid position.
- The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
- If all spots are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
